Project Title: Organ Availability Checking System
Project Description:
The Organ Availability Checking System is a Python-based application developed in PyCharm. The primary purpose of this project is to provide a platform where users can check the availability of organs for transplantation in real-time. This application aims to streamline the process of finding available organs, thereby potentially saving lives by reducing the time required to match donors with recipients.

Features:
User Registration and Authentication: Secure registration and login system for users.
Organ Availability Search: Users can search for available organs based on type, location, and urgency.
Real-time Updates: The system provides real-time updates on organ availability.
Notifications: Users receive notifications when a matching organ becomes available.
Admin Panel: Admins can manage organ listings, donors, and recipient details.
Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for a simple web interface)
Backend: Python with Flask or Django
Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL for storing user data, organ availability, and transaction logs
APIs: RESTful APIs for interaction between frontend and backend
IDE: PyCharm for development
